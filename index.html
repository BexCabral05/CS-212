    <h2> Projects </h2>
        <h3 class="indent">Games</h3>
        <ul class="indent">
            <li> <b>Kingdom of Influence:</b> Kingdom of Influence is an open world fantasy RPG game.
                The game will utilize face recognition technology and dialogue to help 
                adults with autism improve their social skills.
                The game is being developed by Unspecified Studios.
                We are currently partnered with doctors and universities to ensure the game's effectiveness.</li>
            <li> <b>Ex-Terrestrial:</b> Ex-Terrestrial is a short stealth horror game.
                The game was developed during the 2025 ASU Game Jam.
                Teams from 5 universities participated in the event.
                I was a part of NAU's team 2.
                Our game focused on the theme of romance and deception,
                as the player discovers the villain is not who they think.
                Ex-Terrestrial won first place in the game jam.</li>
